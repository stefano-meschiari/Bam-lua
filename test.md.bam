The Collatz conjecture
======================
Also known as the 3n+1 conjecture [Wikipedia][1]. It is a sequence of numbers
with <@ unexpected | surprising | nontrivial @> features. 

The sequence is built as follows: take any integer n. If n is even, divide it
by two; if n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Stop the sequence when n == 1.

%@ n = ceil(tonumber(prompt("Choose an integer number: ") or 6))

You chose <@ n @>.
%@ iters = 0
%@ while n > 1 do
<@ iters + 1 @>. <@ n @> is <@? n % 2 == 0, "even, so we divide by two", "odd, so we multiply by three and add 1" @>.
%@ n = iff(n % 2 == 0, n / 2, 3 * n + 1); iters = iters + 1
%@ end

It took <@ iters @> iterations to get to 1.
